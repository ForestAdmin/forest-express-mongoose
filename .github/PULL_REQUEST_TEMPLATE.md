## Pull Request checklist:

- [ ] Write an explicit title for the Pull Request, following [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
- [ ] Create automatic tests
- [ ] Test manually the implemented changes
- [ ] Review my own code (indentation, syntax, style, simplicity, readability)
- [ ] Wonder if you can improve the existing code
